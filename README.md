# My solution of the Scrimba Dice Game Challenge

Here's me trying to solve the Scrimba dice game challenge without going through the solution. I made the design responsive for smaller screens. The color scheme was left untouched.

As per functionality, I ended up writing 93 lines of JS code as against Scrimba's 47 lines of code. Great numbers apart, I'm however quite excited that I have a working solution.

I can always get better at making my codes DRY.

## JS Concepts covered

For loops
AddEventListener() method
Math methods(Math.random() , Math.floor())
Arrays
